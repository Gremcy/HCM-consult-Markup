              The former polymers division of the Bayer Group has been operating
              under the name Covestro AG since its spin-off in 2015. As part of
              the carve-out process, the existing HR processes and the HR system
              landscape were adopted on a one-to-one basis, following a „clone
              and go“ approach. This HR system infrastructure, tailored to a
              larger organisation, proved too complex, cumbersome and costly for
              Covestro. To better position itself for the future, Covestro
              decided to implement a state of the art HR Cloud /SaaS solution.
              HCM Consultant Group GmbH was commissioned to advise Covestro on
              the selection of a suitable HR cloud provider and to actively
              accompany the selection process.

            processes. With 16,200 employees in more than 30 locations

            fiscal 2017. Covestro has been listed on the stock exchange since

              From a strategic point of view, Covestro opted for a highly
              standardized HR cloud solution that was not very
              personnel-intensive in terms of support, as a replacement for the
              previous On-Premise SAP HR system. Based on its expertise and
              experience in this field, HCM Consultant Group GmbH was
              commissioned to advise Covestro on the selection of a suitable
              cloud provider and to actively accompany the selection process

              The first step in the „HR Cloud Provider Selection“ project was to
              develop the criteria for evaluating the new HR Cloud solution and
              its providers. The „Longlist“ pre-selection of possible providers
              based on market analyses formed the basis for the actual selection
              process:
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              Request for Proposal (RfP): The HR Cloud Providers of the Longlist
              were asked for details about their service within the scope of an
              RfP procedure. For this purpose, the project team designed an
              evaluation catalogue with detailed professional and technical
              requirements. In addition, information on the price model and
              support model was also requested.

              HCM Consultant Group GmbH was already Co- vestro‘s HR/IT
              consulting partner for the 2015 carve-out from the Bayer Group. It
              was thus able to contribute the in-house know-how acquired there
              together with its best practi- ce expertise from other cloud
              provider selection projects in the best possible way to the advan-
              tage of the customer. The consulting spectrum included the
              conception of the RfP, the crea- tion of the Evaluation Score Card
              including the applicable evaluation system and usabili- ty
              criteria as well as the creation of the business case for the
              implementation pro- ject of the future HR Cloud Solution.

              The HR cloud provider selection was a core component of the
              overall project to replace the HR system landscape at Covestro
              that was ta- ken over by Bayer in 2015. On its basis, the provider
              selection could be made reliably and the migration to the new HR
              Cloud solution could be successfully carried out in the meantime.
